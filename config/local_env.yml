# This file should be listed in .gitignore to keep settings secret
# This file overrides ENV variables in the Unix shell

# To add, use the following format:
# GMAIL_USERNAME: 'Your_Gmail_Username'
# This allows the value saved at this key to be used by calling
# ENV["GMAIL_USERNAME"] anywhere in the rails application
